# Go Workspace and Project Generator Script

This is a bash script that creates a new Go workspace and a new Go project within that workspace. The workspace and project are set up according to the Go community's suggested layout.

## Directory Structure

The script creates the following directory structure under a projects folder:

go
├── bin
├── pkg
└── src
    └── github.com
        └── aadriantech
            └── barterking
                ├── build
                ├── cmd
                │   ├── api
                │   └── web
                ├── deployments
                ├── internal
                │   └── platform
                ├── pkg
                │   ├── api
                │   └── db
                ├── scripts
                ├── test
                └── vendor


## Dependencies

The script requires `bash` and `tree`. It assumes you're using a Unix-like environment with these tools installed.

## Usage

1. Save the script to a file, e.g. `setup.sh`.
2. Make the script executable with the command `chmod +x setup.sh`.
3. Run the script with `./setup.sh`.
4. When prompted, enter your GitHub username and the name of the application.

The script will create the directory structure, set up the `GOPATH` environment variable, and update your `PATH`.
